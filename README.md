Modules to connect Gemini with Supabase. Based on Lovables approach, but using Gemini instead.

As in Gemini the inline preview apparently has issues with external modules and imports the html file here now has the js.file embedded.
For production use it for sure is better to use Modules and Imports. Probably gonna make it here like that, but for now for testing and working on Gemini, this is easier.
